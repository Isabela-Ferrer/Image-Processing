# Image-Processing
I used 20 images from Unsplash (10 images of birds and 10 images of lions/tigers) and I modified them. After the processing, all the images were 224 x 224 pixels and in black and white.

To do this I used pytorch transformations to transform the image and then transform the image tensor. I also created a custom dataset with all my the images and uploaded the result to a dataloader to get the dataset ready to train an AI model.
